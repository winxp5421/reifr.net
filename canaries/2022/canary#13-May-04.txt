Special announcements
----------------------

!!!ATTENTION!!!

New PGP Signing Keys will be generated soon!
Both the new and old PGP keys will be used to sign canaries.
Eventually, the old PGP keys will be phased out.
For the time being there will be two signatures on each canary.
More information will be available once a transition plan has been agreed upon. 

Disclaimers and notes
----------------------

This canary scheme is not infallible. Although signing the declaration
makes it very difficult for a third party to produce arbitrary
declarations, it does not prevent them from using force or other
means, like blackmail or compromising the signers' laptops, to coerce
us to produce false declarations.

The news feeds quoted below (Proof of freshness) serves to demonstrate
that this canary could not have been created prior to the date stated.
It shows that a series of canaries was not created in advance.

This declaration is merely a best effort and is provided without any
guarantee or warranty. It is not legally binding in any way to
anybody. None of the signers should be ever held legally responsible
for any of the statements made here.
